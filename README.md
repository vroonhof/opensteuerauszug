# OpenSteuerAuszug

A Python package for generaring Swiss tax statements (Steuerausz√ºge) from brokers' statements that don't support it, e.g. mostly foreign ones.
This goal is to eliminate tedious and error prone manual typing into the tax softwware.

## Disclaimer

TODO: explain that 
- The package is not formally audited
- the main focus is on getting core transaction and interest data.
- These need to be verified by the user before submitting with the tax return
- Tax values are computed best effort for informational purpose (the man Tax software should be able to compute it from the core transaction data.


## Features

- TBD

## Supported Brokers

For now the focus is on brokers / banks that the author has 

- Charles Schwab (main trading account and Equity Awards)
- [planned] Interactive Brokers
  
Additionally we can recalculate and verify any existing steuer-auszug (this is mostly to increase confidence in the software itself)

## Installation

This needs newer version of pdf417gen and (for testing) pdf417decoder than
available on PyPY for now there are my vendored branches

```bash
pip install .
pip install git+https://github.com/vroonhof/pdf417-py.git
```

## Usage

### Generating a Tax statement

```python
