# Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Importer Guide

This guide explains how to prepare your data from [Interactive Brokers (IBKR)](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/) for use with OpenSteuerAuszug.

## Required Input: Flex Query XML File

OpenSteuerAuszug processes IBKR data using [**Flex Query XML files**](https://www.ibkrguides.com/orgportal/performanceandstatements/activityflex.htm). You need to configure a Flex Query in your IBKR Account Management that includes specific sections and fields covering the entire tax year.

### How to Obtain the Flex Query XML:

1.  **Log in** to your IBKR Account Management portal.
2.  Navigate to **"Performance & Reports" > "Flex Queries"**.
3.  (onetime) **Create a new Flex Query** or modify an existing one.
    *   Give your query a descriptive name (e.g., "Annual Tax Report").
    *   Select the **XML format**.
    *   Ensure the following sections are included in your query configuration. The importer relies on specific fields within these sections (see below).
4. [**Run the Flex Query**](https://www.ibkrguides.com/orgportal/performanceandstatements/runflex.htm). Select a *custom date range* that goes from *Jan 1st to Dec 31st in the relevant year*. For some reason the convenient "Last Calendar Year" option is missing from this drop down/

### Essential Flex Query Sections and Fields:

Unfortunately these is no simple way to programmatically set the configuration. However it only needs to be done once and **it should be ok to select all sections and all fields**, so try that first.

The importer uses the `ibflex` library to parse the XML, this can be quite sensitive to Interactive Brokers adding new fields, in that case you can unselect the problematic fields or patch `ibflex`. I provide a vendored fork at https://github.com/vroonhof/ibflex

 Below are the key sections and some of the critical fields expected (I recommend selecting all fields by default to avoid fiddling with the UI):

1.  **Account Information (`AccountInformation`)**:
    *   Provides account holder details.
    *   Fields used: `accountId`, `name`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `accountHolderName`.

2.  **Trades (`Trades`)**:
    *   Details all buy and sell transactions.
    *   Critical fields per trade: `tradeDate`, `settleDateTarget`, `symbol`, `description`, `assetCategory` (STK, OPT, FUT, BOND, ETF, FUND are processed), `conid` (Contract ID), `isin`, `quantity`, `tradePrice`, `tradeMoney`, `currency`, `buySell`, `ibCommission`.

3.  **Open Positions (`OpenPositions`)**:
    *   Snapshot of securities held, typically at the end of the report period.
    *   Critical fields per position: `reportDate`, `symbol`, `description`, `assetCategory`, `conid`, `isin`, `position` (quantity), `currency`.

4.  **Transfers (`Transfers`)**:
    *   Records securities transferred in or out of the account.
    *   Critical fields per transfer: `date` (or `dateTime`), `symbol`, `description`, `conid`, `isin`, `quantity`, `direction` ("IN" or "OUT"), `currency`, `type`, `account`.
    *   *Note: Cash transfers are generally ignored by this section in the importer.*

5.  **Cash Transactions (`CashTransactions`)**:
    *   Details all cash movements including dividends, interest, fees.
    *   Critical fields per transaction: `dateTime` (or `tradeDate`), `description`, `amount`, `currency`, `conid` (if linked to a security), `isin`, `symbol`, `type` (e.g., "Dividends", "Withholding Tax", "Interest", "Fees", "Deposits/Withdrawals").
    *   *Note: "Deposits/Withdrawals" are generally ignored. "Fees" and "BrokerInterestPaid" are logged but not currently used to populate specific cost/liability sections in the Steuerauszug.* "BrokerInterestReceived" is processed as income.

6.  **Cash Report (`CashReport`)**:
    *   Summarizes cash balances for each currency held.
    *   Critical fields per currency entry: `currency` (code), `endingCash` (or `balance` if `reportDate` aligns with period end).
    *   *Note: Entries for "BASE_SUMMARY" currency are ignored.*

4.  **Save and Run the Query**:
    *   Save your Flex Query configuration.
    *   Run the query for the desired period.
5.  **Download the XML File**:
    *   Once the report is generated, download the XML file. This is the file you will provide to OpenSteuerAuszug.

It is crucial that the Flex Query covers the **entire tax year** and is in **XML format**. Missing sections or fields can lead to an incomplete or inaccurate Steuerauszug.

## Configuration (`config.toml`)

Because Interactive Brokers specifies relatively complete data in its exports, this importer currently requires no specific configuration.

## Running Opensteuerauszug

```console
python -m opensteuerauszug.steuerauszug --importer ibkr <flex query xml file> ...
```

## Importer Specifics & Known Quirks

*   **Corporate Actions**: The author does not currently have examples of corporate actions such as stock splits in his real world data. The documentation in this regard from IBKR is very limited. Please review carefully. If you can send sample snippets of how flex statements represent them that would be very welcome

*   **Flex Query Customization**: It's crucial that your Flex Query includes all necessary data fields. Missing fields might lead to incomplete or inaccurate Steuerauszug generation. The code tries to ensure all required fields are present (even if empty when not applicable) but these scenarios have not been extensively tested.

*   **Fees**: Currently fee information is not propagated to to the Steuerauszug.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Missing Data**: If the generated Steuerauszug seems incomplete, double-check that your IBKR reports cover the full tax year and include all necessary sections/fields.
*   **Incorrect Values**: Verify that the currency and amounts in your reports are correctly interpreted.
